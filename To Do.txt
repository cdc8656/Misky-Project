#TO DO:
#CUSTOMER picks up reservation --> completed status
#RESTAURANT gets notified when a reservation is canceled by customer
#RESTAURANTs can cancel their items
#CUSTOMERs are notified when an item they've reserved is canceled
#CUSTOMER's canceled and completed reservations are moved to a different table at end of day
#CUSTOMER's who don't pick up are canceled automatically
#RESTAURANT items past pickup time get moved to a different database (completed items)
